# BTC-Trend-Analyzer

## Introduction  
This project performs a **technical analysis** of Bitcoin (**BTC-USD**) using historical market data from the past two years.  
The goal is to **retrieve, visualize, and analyze** key market indicators to better understand price trends, trading volumes, and volatility.  

We use **Yahoo Financeâ€™s API** (via the `yfinance` Python library) to collect the data and apply several **financial analysis techniques**, including:  
- Price trend visualization  
- Moving Averages (**SMA** & **EMA**)  
- Technical Indicators (**MACD**, trading signals)  
- Volatility Analysis  
- Volume-to-price correlation  
- Monthly performance tracking
