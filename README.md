This project analyzes Bitcoinâ€™s historical market data (BTC-USD) over the past two years using Python and the `yfinance` library. The goal is to visualize price trends, trading volumes, volatility, and key technical indicators such as Moving Averages (SMA & EMA) and MACD signals. The analysis includes daily and monthly performance, volume-to-price correlation, and simple buy/sell signal generation. This workflow serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to financial data analysis in Python and can be adapted to other cryptocurrencies or assets.
